# Introduction

This notebook demonstrates a simple model we trust (no model
misspecification). In this case, cross-validation is not needed, and we
we can get better accuracy using the explicit model.

# Comparison of two groups with Binomial 

An experiment was performed to estimate the effect of beta-blockers on mortality of cardiac patients [the example is from @BDA3, Ch 3]. A group of patients were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups:

- out of 674 patients receiving the control, 39 died
- out of 680 receiving the treatment, 22 died

Data, where `grp2` is a dummy variable that captures the difference of
the intercepts in the first and the second group.
```{r}
d_bin2 <- data.frame(N = c(674, 680), y = c(39,22), grp2 = c(0,1))
```

## Analysis of the observed data

To analyse whether the treatment is useful, we can use Binomial model for both groups and compute odds-ratio.

```{r,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE}
fit_bin2 <- stan_glm(y/N ~ grp2, family = binomial(), data = d_bin2,
                     weights = N, refresh=0)
```

In general we recommend showing the full posterior of the quantity of
interest, which in this case is the odds ratio.
```{r}
samples_bin2 <- rstan::extract(fit_bin2$stanfit)
theta1 <- plogis(samples_bin2$alpha)
theta2 <- plogis(samples_bin2$alpha + samples_bin2$beta)
oddsratio <- (theta2/(1-theta2))/(theta1/(1-theta1))
ggplot() + geom_histogram(aes(oddsratio), bins = 50, fill = 'grey', color = 'darkgrey') +
  labs(y = '') + scale_y_continuous(breaks = NULL)
```

The probability that odds-ratio is less than 1:
```{r}
print(mean(oddsratio<1),2)
```

This posterior distribution of the odds-ratio (or some transformation
of it) is the simplest and the most accurate way to analyse the
effectiveness of the treatment. In this case, there is high probability
that the treatment is effective and relatively big.

## Simulation experiment

Although we recommend showing the full posterior, the probability that oddsratio < 1 can be a useful summary. 
Simulation experiment `binom_odds_comparison.R` runs 100 simulations with simulated data with varying oddsratio (0.1,...,1.0) and computes for each run the probability that oddsratio<1. The following figures show the variation in the results.

Variation in probability that oddsratio<1 when true oddsratio is varied.
```{r}
load(file="binom_test_densities.RData")
ggplot(betaprobs_densities, aes(x = values, y = ind, height = scaled)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(stat = "identity", scale=0.6)
```

# Cross-validation

Sometimes it is better to focus on observable space (we can't observe
$\theta$ or odds-ratio directly, but we can observe $y$).  In
leave-one-out cross-validation, model is fitted $n$ times with each
observation left out at time in fitting and used to evaluate the
predictive performance. This corresponds to using the already seen
observations as pseudo Monte Carlo samples from the future data
distribution, with the leave-trick used to avoid double use of data.
With the often used log-score we get
$$\mathrm{LOO} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log {p(y_i|x_i,D_{-i},M_k)}.$$
Cross-validation is useful when we don't trust any model (the
models might include good enough models, but we just don't know if that is the case).

Next we demonstrate one of the weaknesses of cross-validation (same
holds for WAIC etc.).

## Analysis of the observed data

To use leave-one-out where "one" refers to an individual patient, we
need to change the model formulation a bit. In the above model
formulation, the individual observations have been aggregated to group
observations and running `loo(fit_bin2)` would try to leave one group
completely. In case of having more groups, this could be what we want,
but in case of just two groups it is unlikely. Thus, in the following we 
switch a Bernoulli model with each individual as it's own observation.

```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
d_bin2b <- data.frame(y = c(rep(1,39), rep(0,674-39), rep(1,22), rep(0,680-22)), grp2 = c(rep(0, 674), rep(1, 680)))
fit_bin2b <- stan_glm(y ~ grp2, family = binomial(), data = d_bin2b, seed=180202538, refresh=0)
```

We fit also a "null" model which doesn't use the group variable and thus has common parameter for both groups.'
```{r, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}
fit_bin2bnull <- stan_glm(y ~ 1, family = binomial(), data = d_bin2b, seed=180202538, refresh=0)
```

We can then use cross-validation to compare whether adding the
treatment variable improves predictive performance. We use fast Pareto smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation [PSIS-LOO; @Vehtari+etal:PSIS-LOO:2017].
```{r}
(loo_bin2 <- loo(fit_bin2b))
(loo_bin2null <- loo(fit_bin2bnull))
```
All Pareto $k<0.5$ and we can trust PSIS-LOO result [@Vehtari+etal:PSIS-LOO:2017; @Vehtari+etal:PSIS:2019].

Let's make pairwise comparison.
```{r}
loo_compare(loo_bin2null, loo_bin2)
```
elpd_diff is small compared to se, and thus cross-validation is uncertain whether estimating the treatment effect improves the predictive performance. To put this in perspective, we have $N_1=674$ and $N_2=680$, and 5.8% and 3.2% deaths, and this is now too weak information for cross-validation.

## Simulation experiment

Simulation experiment `binom_odds_comparison.R` runs 100 simulations with simulated data with varying oddsratio (0.1,...,1.0) and computes LOO comparison for each run.

Variation in LOO comparison when true oddsratio is varied.
```{r}
ggplot(looprobs_densities, aes(x = values, y = ind, height = scaled)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(stat = "identity", scale=0.6)
```

We see that using the posterior distribution from the model is more
efficient to detect the effect, but cross-validation will detect it
eventually too. The difference here comes that cross-validation
doesn't trust the model, compares the model predictions to the "future
data" using very weak assumption about the future. The weak assumption
about the future is also the cross-validation strength as we we'll see
in another notebook.

# Reference predictive approach

We can also do predictive performance estimates using stronger assumption about the future. A reference predictive estimate with log-score can be computed as
$$\mathrm{elpd}_{\mathrm{ref}}  = \int p(\tilde{y}|D,M_*) \log p(\tilde{y}|D,M_k) d\tilde{y}, $$
where $M_*$ is a reference model we trust. Using a reference model to assess the other models corresponds to $M$-completed case [@Vehtari+Ojanen:2012], where the true model is replaced with a model we trust to be close enough to the true model.

## Simulation experiment

The next figure shows the results from the same simulation study using a reference predictive approach with the `fit_bin2` model used as the reference. 
```{r}
ggplot(refprobs_densities, aes(x = values, y = ind, height = scaled)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(stat = "identity", scale=0.6)
```

We can see better accuracy than for cross-validation. The similar improvement in the model selection performance is observed in projection predictive variable selection [@Piironen+Vehtari:2017a; @Piironen+etal:projpred:2020] implemented in [`projpred` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=projpred).

# Marginal likelihood

As comparison we include marginal likelihood based approach to compute the posterior probabilities for the null model (treatment effect is zero) and the model with unknown treatment effect. As the data and models are very simple, we may assume that the model is well specified. Marginal likelihoods and relative posterior probabilities can be sensitive to selected prior on the more complex model. Here we simply use the same prior as for the above examples. Marginal likelihoods are computed using the default bridge sampling approach implemented in `bridge_sampling` package.

## Analysis of the observed data

```{r}
# rerun models with diagnostic file required by bridge_sampler
fit_bin2 <- stan_glm(y/N ~ grp2, family = binomial(), data = d_bin2,
                     weights = N, refresh=0,
                     diagnostic_file = file.path(tempdir(), "df.csv"))
(ml_bin2 <- bridge_sampler(fit_bin2, silent=TRUE))
fit_bin2null <- stan_glm(y/N ~ 1, family = binomial(), data = d_bin2,
                     weights = N, refresh=0,
                     diagnostic_file = file.path(tempdir(), "df.csv"))
(ml_bin2null <- bridge_sampler(fit_bin2null, silent=TRUE))
print(post_prob(ml_bin2, ml_bin2null), digits=2)
```

Posterior probability computed from the marginal likelihoods is indecisive.

## Simulation experiment

We repeat the simulation with marginal likelihood approach.
```{r}
ggplot(bfprobs_densities, aes(x = values, y = ind, height = scaled)) + 
  geom_density_ridges(stat = "identity", scale=0.6)
```

We can see that marginal likelihood based approach favors more strongly null model for smaller treatment effects, requires a bigger effect than the other approaches to not favor the null model, but given big enough effect is more decisive on non-null model than cross-validation.
